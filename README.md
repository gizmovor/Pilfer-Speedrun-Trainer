# Pilfer-Speedrun-Trainer
Speedrun trainer for the game Pilfer: Story of Light made with cheat engine


What it currently does:                                                                                       
-F1: Heal to full then freeze Hp to have infinite hp                                                                                     
-F2: save your position                                                                                       
-F3: Tp back to saved position (or to 0,0,0 if nothing has been saved yet)                                                                      
-F4: freeze vertical velocity and enables space to be a hotkey ( a bit janky cause the game will try to make you slowly fall still)                                                                                    
-Space: if fly hack is enabled, sets game speed to x4 and gives some vertical velocity as long as you hold it
